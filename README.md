# FORECASTING_ENERGY_DEMAND_IOT
Our project aims to leverage "IOT" data for accurately forecasting energy demands, facilitating efficient resource allocation and grid management. Through advanced analytics, we empower utilities to optimize energy distribution, reduce costs, and enhance reliability, thus contributing to a more sustainable and resilient energy infrastructure.
